## Eldritch
This repository holds for source material for a game titled Eldritch, to be held at the spring 2016 jtTalks.

Eldritch is an edularp, or educational live-action roleplaying game. It blends elements of fantasy tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, programming tutorials in the format of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks), and game-based learning approaches to computer science such as [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/). Students assume the roles of political leaders in the fictional continent of Caeros, which is under attack by hostile subterranean creatures known as aberrants while also facing an internet crisis of governance. An analogy is drawn between real-world programming challanges and in-game uses of the mysterious eldritch tongue, a language whose utterances produce magical effects. By executing snippets of code, students' characters accomplish in-game tasks, accumulate experience points and influence for their factions, and ultimately turn the tide of the invasion.

Additional information on the game world of Eldritch can be found at our [wiki](https://github.com/cferko/eldritch/wiki). The game is designed to be run via the Binder service; to generate a new instance of the Eldritch game on a fresh server, use the link below:

All of the source code for the project is in Python and iPython/Jupyter notebooks, and is freely available above. The project is still very much in development; documents are incomplete, and code and explanatory text is often incorrect. Individual Jupyter notebooks can be viewed online in browser, but the interactive elements of the simulation can be accessed only if the project is running on a Binder web server.

# Motivation

Substantial educational research has focused on the efficacy of [game-based](https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/GAME01/GAME01.pdf) [learning] (https://www.edsurge.com/news/2013-08-19-a-meta-analyses-on-the-research-behind-game-based-learning), and more generally on non-traditional pedagogical approaches such as [active learning](http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Prince_AL.pdf), [project-based learning](http://bie.org/images/uploads/general/9d06758fd346969cb63653d00dca55c0.pdf), and [inquiry-based learning](http://galileo.org/focus-on-inquiry-lit-review.pdf). Although the results are far from conclusive, preliminary evidence suggests that each of these approaches improves student engagement and learning outcomes over more passive models such as the traditional lecture method.
