# notebooks

This will consist of "mutable" notebooks that the players use.

Each folder in this directory is the personal working space for a given player. It will contain that player's character sheet and the landing page that they open when the game begins (these might be the same notebook -- I haven't decided yet).

Fresh copies of new notebooks will be copied into the corresponding directories as the story progresses.

Each folder also contains the checkpoints and logs for the player. These individual logs are periodically aggregated and combined in the /home/logs folder.
