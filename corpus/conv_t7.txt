An artificer is not a spellcaster, but he
does have the ability to imbue items with magical infusions.
Infusions are neither arcane nor divine; they are
drawn from the artificer infusion list (see Chapter 5:
Magic). They function just like spells and follow all the
rules for spells. For example, an infusion can be dispelled,
it will not function in an antimagic area, and an artificer
must make a Concentration check if injured while imbuing
an item with an infusion.
An artificer can imbue an item with any infusion
from the list without preparing the infusion ahead of time.
Unlike a sorcerer or bard, he does not select a subset of the
available infusions as his known infusions; he has access
to every infusion on the list that is of a level he can use.
It is possible for an artificer to learn infusions that
are not on the normal artificer infusion list. These might
include ancient infusions he finds in the ruins of Xen'drik
or secret infusions known only to the members of certain
guilds or organizations. When he encounters such an
infusion, an artificer can attempt to learn it by making
a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). If this check succeeds,
he adds the infusion to his list. If not, he can try
again when he gains another rank in Spellcraft, assuming
he still has access to the new infusion.
