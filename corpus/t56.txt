Kythri, the Churning Chaos
A roiling soup of land, water, air, protoplasmic ooze, fire,
magma, hissing steam, smoke, dust, ice, blinding light,
pitch darkness, acid, flashing lightning, cacophonous
sound, and seemingly every other substance and energy
found in the universe fills the plane of Kythri. Every part
of the plane constantly changes. A creature, native or just
visiting, can sometimes exert enough will to hold a location
constant and stable—for a short time.
