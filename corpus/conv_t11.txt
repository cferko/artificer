Bards usually don't end up as wandering minstrels or
street performersany expert with a Perform skill can fill
that role. Instead, some bards use their magical abilities to
unearth ancient lore, while others use their interpersonal
skills and bardic music to advance their careers as spies,
ambassadors, diplomats, and chroniclers. As such, bards
find employ as adventurers, as well as in governments and
among the mercantile houses.
Zilargo produces a large number of bards, since the
gnomes' love of knowledge makes them particularly well
suited to this class. In other areas, bards appear most often
in the large cities and towns throughout Breland, Karrnath,
Thrane, and (particularly) Aundair. Bards with
wilder ties are found in the Eldeen Reaches, particularly
among the druid sect of the Greensingers.
