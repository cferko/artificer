THRONEHOLD
The ancient capital of the kingdom of Galifar rests in the
middle of Scions Sound. This island, situated between
the Five Nations, contains the mighty castle from which
King Galifar I and his descendants ruled the continent. A
special detachment of House Donric guardsthe Throne
Wardenscontinues to protect Thronehold to this day,
though the guards serve more as caretakers now that the
kingdom no longer has a single recognized king.
The Throne Wardens maintain the castle and the
island around it in anticipation of one day welcoming a new
King (or Queen) of Galifar home. They have maintained
their post since the death of Jarot and the start of the Last
War, though House Donric has reduced their number
to a token force over the years as other duties demanded
more manpower.
King Kaius decided to hold the peace talks to end the
Last War on this solemn, almost mythical island. Indeed,
he was surprised at how the wardens had kept the place
in good repair, and amazed that apparently none of the
battle of the Last War ever touched the island. It remains
a neutral place, a memory in stone of the glory that once
spanned the Five Nations.
