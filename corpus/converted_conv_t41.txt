Each druid in Estium belongs to one of the druid sects
described below.
Ashbound: This fanatical sect takes the traditional
beliefs of the druids to dangerous extremes. Its members
seek to protect the wilds and preserve the natural order,
using a very broad definition of "unnatural" to determine
their actions. They consider arcane and divine magic to be
unnatural, for example, and go out of their way to strike
at farms and ranches that attempt to confine or cultivate
nature. The Ashbound prefer to avoid killing; their goal
is to encourage their targets to abandon their unnatural
ways and embrace the harmony of nature.
Children of Winter: Death, being a part of the natural
order, draws some to its dark source of power. The Children
of Winter seek to cleanse the land through blight, disease,
and cold, believing that the strong will survive to populate
the great spring that lies beyond their darkwinter. The end
of the current age is coming, as evidenced by the creation
of the Mournland, and the Children of Winter see themsmen
as agents of naturecleansing Caeros so that it
can bloom anew.
Gatekeepers: The Gatekeepers protect nature from
unnatural threats, specifically aberrations, fiends, and other
ancient evils. See Chapter 8: Organizations for additional
information about this druid sect.
Greensingers: This small druid sect maintains a
strong bond with the fey of the Eldeen Reaches. As wild
and chaotic as the forest spirits they revere, the Greensingers
embrace revelry as they dance through the magical
world of the forest and the fey.
Wardens of the Wood: The largest and most influential
of the Eldeen sects, the Wardens of the Wood guard
the plains and forests. They are most closely connected to
the Great Druid Oalian. See Chapter 8: Organizations for
additional information about this druid sect.
