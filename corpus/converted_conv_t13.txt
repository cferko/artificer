Something prowled the forest that surrounded the village, an unnatural
presence that seared the air and made animals flee in mortal terror. Vanira
strummed the strings of her lute, calling forth a song of protection. The
melody surrounded her like a suit of enchanted armor, and she hoped it
would be enough when the presence revealed itself.
Suddenly the forest around her darkened, as though a shadow moved
across the sun. She maintained the melody, vocalizing the tune so that her
hands were free to operate her crossbow. The darkness struck like a whip,
slicing through her defenses and filling her with a fear unlike anything she
had ever experienced before.
"Demon," she whispered, tryingto keep the fear from paralyzing her.
"There's a demon loose in the Reaches."
A well-known chronicler with a haunting voice and
an ability to track down stories of epic proportion, the
9th-level gnome bard Vanira grew up in Korranberg,
Zilargo's bustling capital city. Since taking up the mantle
of bard, she has traveled the Five Nations to bring stories
of news and wonder to her readers at the Korranberg
Chroniclethe independent source of information distributed
throughout central Caeros that became
famous for its accounts of the Last War and put the job
of chronicler on the map.
Recently, Vanira took up the company of the druid
Janar and his wolf companion, Oru. These adventurers
haunt the Eldeen Reaches, defending small farms from
the Ashbound and occasionally collaborating with groups
of Greensingers and their fey allies to keep the Reaches
safe and secure. Vanira believes that there is a story waiting
to be told in the Reaches, and she has teamed up with the
druid to find it.
