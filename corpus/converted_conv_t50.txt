DRAGONSHARDS
Dragonshards appear in three distinct forms, each associated
with and originating in a different part of the world.
These crystal fragments can be shaped and used to power
magic items, artifacts, and constructs, or to enhance the
abilities bestowed by dragonmarks.
All eldershards appear as translucent rock or crystal
with swirling veins of color suspended within them.
The veins are reminiscent of dragonmarks but are not
copies of them, and the pulsating veins make the stones
look almost alive. Though eldershards are translucent,
the glowing veins running through them lend their color
to each crystal.
Siberys eldershards fall from the Ring of Siberys
that forms a broken path across the night sky. A pulsating
swirl of golden veins glows within the crystalline depths
of a Siberys dragonshard.
Belmead eldershards are found deep in the earth,
near layers of magma. These living crystals typically grow
on cavern walls. A Belmead dragonshard has writhing,
midnight blue to oily black veins running through it.
Estium eldershards are buried in the shallow
soil of the world and are usually found encased
in geodelike stone eggs. An Estium dragonshard has
crimson, blood-red swirls churning within its crystalline
surface.
Dragonshards and the uses associated with them are
described in Chapter 10: Magic Items.
