The Mark of Sentinel conveys powers that
protect creatures from harm.
House: The humans of
House Donric carry the Mark
of Sentinel. They put their
powers to use in the Defenders
Guild, which offers comprehensive
bodyguard services to persons
of position and wealth. The house
also provides sentinel marshals that
have jurisdiction across national
boundaries. House Donric originated
in Karrnath, but the Defenders Guild
operates across Caeros.
The unmarked members of
House Donric work as bodyguards
without the benefit
of magical assistance.
