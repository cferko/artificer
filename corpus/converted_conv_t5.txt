In Estium, magic is almost technology. Spellcasters specialize
in certain forms of that technology, while artificers
tinker with its fundamental workings. Artificers understand
magic on a different level from spellcasters, and do
not cast spells as wizards and clerics do. They have an amazing
facility with magic items and constructs, and in many
ways, they keep the magical world of Estium running.
