The ancient depths of Pran, the tangled jungles of
Q'barra, the howling crags of the Demon Wastes, and the
cyclopean ruins of Xen'drik are like home to the extreme
explorer. Whether motivated by a thirst for knowledge
about Estium's most ancient civilizations, a hunger
for the long-lost secrets of tremendous arcane power, or
simply a lust for gold, extreme explorers subject themsmen
to tremendous danger to achieve their goalsand somehow
manage to escape in one piece, often by the skin of their
teeth. The extreme explorer is the iconic action hero of
Estium: courageous, resourceful, determined, andjust
plain lucky.
The key feature of the extreme explorer is his use
of action points. He gains more action points than most
other characters, and gains action-oriented bonus feats to
help him spend those points in dramatically heroic ways.
Members of any class can qualify to become extreme
explorers without much difficulty, though rogues have a
particular inclination toward this prestige class.
NPC extreme explorers are quite rare. They work best
in the campaign as plot devices. They can fail to return from
an expedition deep beneath Pran, send their notebooks to
a PC pupil before disappearing forever in Xen'drik, or hire
the PCs to accompany them into the Demon Wastes.
