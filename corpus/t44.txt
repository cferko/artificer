The people of Khorvaire have a limited understanding of
dragonmarks, and Siberys marks are a complete mystery.
The magic of a Siberys mark is undeniably powerful, generally
duplicating a spell of 7th or 8th level. Siberys marks
are clearly related—visually, thematically, and genetically—
to the other marks in their house. A dragonmark heir
may spend years perfecting and mastering the powers of
his mark, but can never manifest a Siberys mark, while an
unmarked scion of a dragonmarked house might suddenly
display a Siberys mark against all expectations. Siberys marks
are mighty, unpredictable, and rare, and the dragonmarked
houses keep a careful eye on anyone who manifests one. If
its power can be used in the service of the house, fine—but
an heir of Siberys who does not conceal his dragonmark
ability or remain firmly aligned with his house is likely to
find himself the target of assassins.
