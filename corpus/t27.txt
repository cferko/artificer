The Mark of Finding
bestows powers
related to locating
creatures or objects,
making those who carry it
useful as investigators or bounty hunters.
In addition, members of the Finders Guild
serve an essential role in locating dragonshards
and selling them to other guilds
for attunement.
House: House Tharashk
is a family of halforcs
and humans
originally from the
region around the
Shadow Marches. It
controls the Finders
Guild, which
includes freelance
inquisitives, some
law enforcement
agents, explorersfor-hire,
and dragonshard
prospectors. The Finders Guild
concentrates its efforts in western
Khorvaire, where
a lucrative dragonshard
prospecting
business flourishes,
although its members
are found in
every major town
and city.
The unmarked
members of House
Tharashk assist their
Siberys
dragonmarked kin in every area; they offer mundane
investigative services and help on dragonshard prospecting
expeditions
