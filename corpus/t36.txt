The Mark of Storm grants the power to control weather,
primarily through the manipulation of clouds, wind, and
rain. A character with this mark can create a short, localized
drizzle or a powerful rainstorm, a short breeze, or
enough wind to propel a ship across the sea.
House: The half-elves of House Lyrandar carry the
Mark of Storm. Their Windwrights Guild dominates the
business of shipping and transportation over both sea
and sky. Their Raincallers Guild provides services to
farmers across Khorvaire. Both guilds are found in
every coastal nation of Khorvaire, and they proudly
trace their ancestry to the elves of Aerenal and the
humans of Thrane.
Unmarked members of House Lyrandar are prosperous
farmers, plantation owners, and sailors crewing the
ships driven by their marked relatives.
