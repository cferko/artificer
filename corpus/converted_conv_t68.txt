SURNAMES
Most folk carry a common surname, either a family name
or a name related to their region of origin or job. Sorn
Fellhorn, Kara of Windshire, and Tellan Magewright are
all examples of naming conventions among the common
folk of the Five Nations. Those born outside the Five
Nations may follow this convention, or may not carry a
name other than their given name.
The royal families that trace their roots to the original
kings and nobles of the Five Nations, as well as those
granted land and titles in more recent times, add an ir'
in front of their surname. So, Queen Aurala of Aundair
carries the name of Galifar's kings, ir'Wynarn, while a
vassal lord identifies himself as Lord Darro ir'Lain. This
practice extends to the Mror Holds and Zilargo, where
some dwarf and gnome families were granted titles by the
Galifar rulers.
In a practice that predates Galifar and was introduced
after the War of the Mark, those born of the blood of the
eldermarked houses add a d' to their surnames. Merrix
d'Cadon, Orum d'Kjaldar, and Elsen d'Micaeli are
all blood members of the eldermarked houses.
