The Mark of Handling grants powers related to the care
and control of animals.
House: The humans of House Vadalis carry the Mark
of Handling. Their Handlers Guild controls the business
of breeding and selling livestock throughout Khorvaire.
Though the elves of Valenar are gaining a reputation for
breeding the finest horses in Khorvaire, their steeds are
rare and expensive, while House Vadalis provides a strong,
loyal, and affordable mount.
Unmarked members of House Vadalis are animal
handlers, breeders, auctioneers, stablekeepers, drivers,
and teamsters.
