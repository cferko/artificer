The Mark of Making grants the power to mend or fabricate
material goods.
House: The humans of House Cannith carry the
Mark of Making. Members of their Tinkers Guild often
travel as widely as more traditional tinkers, stopping in
villages to repair goods as they go. House Cannith also
runs the Fabricators Guild, whose members include those
with lesser or greater marks who can fabricate new items
rather than just repair old ones.
Unmarked members of House Cannith are well-to-do
artisans and, less often, mundane tinkers.
