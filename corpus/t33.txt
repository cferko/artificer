The Mark of Scribing grants powers
related to writing and communication.
Those who carry it specialize in the magic
of the written word, serving as diplomats
and translators or facilitating communication
over long distances.
House: The gnomes of House
Sivis carry the Mark of Scribing.
This house controls the
Speakers Guild, which offers
the services of translators and
mediators and can facilitate instantaneous
long-range communication by
means of sending. In addition, House Sivis
controls the Notaries Guild, which uses
arcane mark to certify legal documents and
similar work. This guild also prepares
secure documents intended for specific
recipients using illusory script and performs
transcription and copying services.
House Sivis originated
in Zilargo and has spread
along with the gnomes
throughout the Five Nations.
The house does not usually
operate in regions where
gnomes are rare.
The unmarked members
of House Sivis serve as mediators,
scribes, messengers, go-betweens,
and sometimes diplomats.
