The Mark of Finding
bestows powers
related to locating
creatures or objects,
making those who carry it
useful as investigators or bounty hunters.
In addition, members of the Finders Guild
serve an essential role in locating eldershards
and selling them to other guilds
for attunement.

agents, explorersfor-hire,
and dragonshard

business flourishes,
although its members
are found in
every major town
and city.
