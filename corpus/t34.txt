The Mark of Sentinel conveys powers that
protect creatures from harm.
House: The humans of
House Deneith carry the Mark
of Sentinel. They put their
powers to use in the Defenders
Guild, which offers comprehensive
bodyguard services to persons
of position and wealth. The house
also provides sentinel marshals that
have jurisdiction across national
boundaries. House Deneith originated
in Karrnath, but the Defenders Guild
operates across Khorvaire.
The unmarked members of
House Deneith work as bodyguards
without the benefit
of magical assistance.
