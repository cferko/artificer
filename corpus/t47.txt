Weretouched masters are shifters who learn to enhance
their shifting ability to accentuate the power of their
lycanthrope heritage. They quickly learn not just to alter
their humanoid form but to actually take on animal forms
as their ancestors did. Over time, they grow to master
both animal and hybrid forms of all the once-common
lycanthropes. Along with their growing mastery of their
physical form, weretouched masters become increasingly
wild in spirit, less comfortable in human society.
Most weretouched masters begin their careers as
rangers or barbarians and seek to enhance their combat
ability through mastery of animal forms. Few are druids,
because druids learn to assume more animal forms more
quickly than weretouched masters and have little to gain
from this class.
The Eldeen Reaches are home to the greatest number
of NPC weretouched masters. The more advanced
masters enjoy the rugged wilderness and stay far from
human civilization.
