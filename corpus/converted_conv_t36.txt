The Mark of Storm grants the power to control weather,
primarily through the manipulation of clouds, wind, and
rain. A character with this mark can create a short, localized
drizzle or a powerful rainstorm, a short breeze, or
enough wind to propel a ship across the sea.
House: The half-men of House Larenthil carry the
Mark of Storm. Their Windwrights Guild dominates the
business of shipping and transportation over both sea
and sky. Their Raincallers Guild provides services to
farmers across Caeros. Both guilds are found in
every coastal nation of Caeros, and they proudly
trace their ancestry to the men of Aerenal and the
humans of Thrane.
Unmarked members of House Larenthil are prosperous
farmers, plantation owners, and sailors crewing the
ships driven by their marked relatives.
