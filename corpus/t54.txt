Fernia, the Sea of Fire
Flame covers everything on Fernia, the Sea of Fire. The
ground is nothing more than great, ever-shifting plates
of compressed flame, ash, and debris. The air ripples with
the heat of continual firestorms. Oceans of liquid flame
ebb and flow, and mountains ooze with molten lava. Fire
rages, with no need for fuel or air, across this continually
burning landscape.
