Oru growled uneasily, andjanar reached down to stroke behind the great
wolf's ear. "I feel it, too, my friend," the half-orc druid said, realizing
that it might not have been such a good idea to split the group for this
particular patrol. The forest creatures all around him seemed frightened
to a degree that he had never felt before, and that meant that something
unnatural and terribly evil was loose in the Reaches.
"We need to find Vanira and the others,"Janar told the wolf "I think
we can cover more ground if I join you, Oru." With that, the druid called
forth his wild shape, instantly transforming himself into a dire wolf Oru
sniffed Janar's wolf shape in greeting, and then let out an impatient bark.
Janar howled in agreement. They had to find the rest of the group before
whatever was out there found them.
The wolf and the dire wolf ran deeper into the forest, matching each
other stride for stride as they fought to keep the steadily growing sense of
danger from overwhelming them.
Often described as down-to-earth, the 9th-level halforc
druid Janar grew up in the Shadow Marches. He
earned fame in his village while he was still quite young
by taming a wild wolfhis animal companion, Oru. Wanderlust
struck him in his teenage years, and he and Oru
journeyed to the Eldeen Reaches. There he met a gnome
bard, the chronicler Vanira, and their friendship developed
quickly. They travel the Eldeen Reaches as she looks
for tales to chronicle and he seeks to protect the natural
world from supernatural dangers.
Janar follows rumors of an ancient druid tradition
that predates human civilization on Khorvaire, a tradition

that might be related to the orcs. Intrigued by this possible
connection between his orc heritage and his vocation, Janar
seeks to learn more about the mysterious Gatekeepers so that
he can be initiated into their secrets.
