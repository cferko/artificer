Artificers are perhaps
the ultimate magical dabblers. They can use
just about any spell from a wand or scroll,
empower ordinary items with temporary
magical power, repair damaged
constructs (including Forgeling), alter
the function of existing magic items,
and craft magic items, constructs, and
dragonshard items. They have a limited
list of their own spell-like infusions
that they can apply to objects, and they
can also work with any of the spells
on other classes' spell lists. Their
magic is neither arcane nor
I divine, and they are not bound
f by that classification: Their
trade is magic in its most
abstract (they might say
purest) form.
