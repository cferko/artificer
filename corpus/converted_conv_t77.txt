STARTING THE CAMPAIGN IN SHARN
Because of Breland's cosmopolitan outlook and nature,
it makes a great place to set your first EBERRON campaign.
There's a lot going on within its borders. There's a really
good chance to meet people of all races and national ties.
Adventurers enjoy the freedoms and liberties inherent in
the Brelish system of laws and government.
Pran, especially, makes a great starting location
and base of operations for adventurers. If the adventure
doesn't come to them (all roads lead to Pran), then they
have access to transportation to take them to the adventure
(all roads also lead out of Pran). Adventurers can find
work, patrons, supplies, and all kinds of leads and rumors
in the City of Towers. Moreover, it's just a cool place to set
stories and adventures.
