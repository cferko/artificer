The dragonmarked houses are a significant force in the
politics and economics of Khorvaire, though their political
influence is usually behind the scenes and often quite subtle.
Perhaps as many as one person in a hundred has a blood
connection to one of the twelve houses. Of these thousands,
however, no more than half actually manifest a dragonmark.
Even more rare are the individuals who demonstrate a natural
ability to improve and use their dragonmark powers in
ways that go well beyond others in their houses. These
exceptional individuals are dragonmark heirs.
Dragonmark heirs have the ability to improve the
dragonmarks they have manifested, as well as to develop
additional abilities related to their dragonmarks.
Dragonmark heir NPCs fill a wide variety of roles
within the dragonmarked houses. To some extent, they
command a degree of respect from unmarked members of
the house, but a more powerful mark does not necessarily
equate to a position of leadership. The economic realities
of Khorvaire demand leadership from those with a keen
mind for business, which does not necessarily go hand in
hand with a more powerful dragonmark.
