Despite the advanced civilization that dominates Khorvaire,
barbarians live in several places both on that continent
and in nearby lands. Human, orc, and half-orc
barbarians emerge from the Shadow Marches and
Demon Wastes. Halfling barbarians ride the Talenta
Plains. Human, half-elf, and shifter barbarians fill the
Eldeen Reaches, though isolated groups of elf, dwarf,
and even gnome barbarians live there as well. Darguun
harbors some bugbear barbarians, and Droaam is home
to barbarians of other monstrous species. Some of the
wilder warforged that roam the Mournland take up the
barbarian class as well.
Beyond Khorvaire, tribes of human barbarians live
on the northern shore of Argonnessen and the nearby
island of Seren, serving the dragons they revere. Finally,
stories abound of children stranded in Xen'drik and
raised by wild beasts or savage humanoids, giving rise to
another source for barbarian characters
