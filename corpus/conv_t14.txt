Clerics are the knights of the churches of Khorvaire,
trained in warfare and blessed with divine power. They
fight for the causes of their religions, serving at the command
of a higher authority. Most temples are staffed by
acolytes who can wield divine magic but do not have the
fighting prowess of clerics. Clerics are the champions and
defenders of the faith.
Other clerics across Eberron serve no church and
claim no allegiance to any deity. They recognize the power
of the deities, but not their authority over mortal life.
They hold principles of alignment or other abstract
ideals higher than the deities who claim these ideals
in their portfolios, and they draw divine power from
the pervasive spiritual force in the world instead of
channeling it through deities. These clerics are usually
outcasts and loners, but the reality of their power
is impossible to deny, and it lends credence to their
unorthodox theology
