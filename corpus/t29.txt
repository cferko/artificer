The Mark of Healing grants curative magical powers.
House: The halflings of House Jorasco carry the Mark
of Healing and operate the Healers Guild, which controls
both the mundane and magical healing trades. A sick or
injured person in Khorvaire is far more likely to seek
healing from the Healers Guild than from any temple, and
in fact most temples do not offer healing services for sale
(though they still heal their own champions and faithful
when necessary).
Unmarked members of House Jorasco are expertly
trained in the healing arts, as well as in fields such as
alchemy and herbalism.
