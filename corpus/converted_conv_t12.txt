Bards have a unique way of tapping into the magic that
pervades Estium: through music. Some bards claim that
the Dragon Above sang the world into being at the dawn
of time, and that their music is an echo of that powerful
tune of creation.
Reflecting this connection to the forces of creation,
bards have access to a number of feats that extend the
powers of their bardic music. A bard can take these feats
any time she would normally gain a feat, or can choose one
of them as a bonus feat instead of gaining a new form of
bardic music at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, or 18th level.
These bard feats are Haunting Melody, Music of
Growth, Music of Making, Song of the Heart, and Soothe
the Beast.
