The half-men of House
Micaeli carry the Mark of Detection.
One of the youngest of the
eldermarked houses,
House Micaeli organized
into a mercantile
house as a result
of the War of the
Mark that ended
fifteen hundred
years ago. Despite
the fact that it has
stood as an established
mercantile house for fifteen
Least
Lesser
centuries, some of the older houses still
view House Micaeli as an upstart. Unconcerned
with the opinions of its peers, House
Micaeli controls the Warning Guild, which
offers services related to personal protection.
House Micaeli originated in Breland
and continues to concentrate its efforts
in the central region of Caeros.
Unmarked members of House
Micaeli sell their services as scouts,
sentries, and similar occupations
