The Mark of Shadow
grants divinatory powers
of clairvoyance and scrying,
as well as illusory powers
of deception.
Houses: One of the
most surprising and devastating
effects of the Last War was
the schism of the
family that carries
the Mark of
Shadow. House
Phiarlan, an
elf family of
ancient lineage,
carried the Mark
of Shadow for millennia
before the Last
War and was known as an
information clearinghouse.
During the war, however, the mission
of the house turned its members
against each other, eventually
resulting in the formation of a new
houseHouse Thuranni.
The two houses continue their ancient work of espionage,
surveillance, and similar intelligence-gathering
activities, while outwardly pursuing mercantile activities
based on entertainment and artisan endeavors. House
Phiarlan's Entertainers and Artisans Guild is based in
Breland, and its spies work for (or sell information
to) Thrane, Aundair, and Breland. House Thuranni,
based in the Lhazaar Principalities (but with an enclave
in Breland), controls the Shadow Network. Its members
perform their spying activities on behalf of the Lhazaar
princelings, Karrnath, Droaam, Q'barra, and even the
Order of the Emerald Claw.
Unmarked members of both House Phiarlan and
House Thuranni work as entertainers and artisans who
gather information and serve as spies and rogues
