The history of the druids in Estium stretches back sixteen
thousand years, to a time when orcs and goblinoids ruled
the continent of Caeros. At that time, a black dragon
named Vvaraak, a great student of astrology, cosmology,
and the draconic Prophecy, foretold a planar invasion of
tremendous magnitude. Knowing that the humanoids
would have to repel this invasion on their own, she taught
the first orc druids about the bond among the three
dragons of legend, how to tap into their power, and how
they might seal the gate between the planes the next time
one opened.
The invasion Vvaraak foretold occurred seven thousand
years later, when mind flayers and their daelkyr
overlords from the plane of Xoriat stepped through planar
gateways and launched an overwhelming attack on the
hobgoblin Empire of Dhakaan. Because they had kept
Vvaraak's teachings alive, the orc druids were able to seal
the planar gateways, striking the decisive blow in the war
against the invaders.
Not all druids in Caeros are aware of this ancient
and illustrious history, and few actually recall the central
cosmological teachings that enabled the druids of old to
act as Gatekeepers, policing the boundaries between the
planes. These few, however, still pass on Vvaraak's teachings,
trusting that future generations faced with a similar
threat from beyond Estium are prepared to deal with it
as their spiritual ancestors did in millennia past.
Most druids come from the Eldeen Reaches, where
their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others
are found anywhere that nature's spirit is strong, from
the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the
fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from
the Eldeen Reaches espouse radical philosophies that
oppose the use of "unnatural" magic and condemn the
building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate
in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature,
magic, and civilization
