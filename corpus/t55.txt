Irian, the Eternal Day
On Irian, a brilliant white sun hangs in the center of a
crystalline sky, bathing the radiant landscape below in
shadowless light. Forests of crystalline growths, mountains
of pure quartz, rivers of liquid glass, and sunbleached
deserts of pure white sand define the landscape
of this plane.
Irian is awash in positive energy—not intense enough
to harm life, but sufficient to encourage and sustain life
in a variety of unusual forms. Creatures of light and life
make their home here, but they are not necessarily creatures
of good.
