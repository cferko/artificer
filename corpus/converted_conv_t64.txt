THE KORRANBERG CHRONICLE
Many towns and cities have long traditions of town criers,
newsbearers who present important or interesting information
in squares, courts, or other public gathering places.
It wasn't long before the magical arts allowed for a more
permanent method of presentation, and the chronicles
were born. The simplest chronicles appear as scrolls nailed
to public message boards containing the pertinent news of
the week. More ambitious chronicles, including the Breland
Ledger, the Pran Inquisitive, and the Aundairian Scroll, are pre -
sented as folded broadsheets nested together to form simple
books. Each edition is collected and stored, eventually being
bound as a chronicle of news and information.
By far, the most well known and widely read chronicle
is the Korranberg Chronicle. Thanks to its relentless and mostly
unbiased coverage of the Last War, and through a distribution
deal with House Oraite, the Korranberg Chronicle enjoys a loyal
and avid readership throughout central Caeros.
A typical edition of the Korranberg Chronicle features
news from around the Five Nations, Zilargo, and the Mror
Holds, as well as stories of adventurers and exciting expeditions,
business solicitations, royal proclamations, and
almanac information. While the main offices are located in
Korranberg, the Chronicle employs chroniclers far and wide,
and maintains field offices in every major nation. House
Oraite distributes each edition (the Chronicle appears three
days a week; Mol, Wir, and Far) along its mail and lightning
rail runs, allowing the Chronicle to reach a huge audience.
Indeed, almost everyone in the Five Nations knows
the Chronicle slogan: "If it happens in the Five Nations, you'll
read about it in the Korranberg Chronicle."
