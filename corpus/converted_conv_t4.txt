WARFORGED
Built as mindless machines to figfht in the Last War,
the Forgeling developed sentience as a side effect of the
arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate
weapons of destruction. With each successive model
that emerged from the creation forges of House Cadon,
the Forgeling evolved until they became a new kind of
creatureliving constructs.
Forgeling are renowned for their combat prowess,
their size, and their single-minded focus. They make
steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. Earlier Forgeling
models are true constructs; some of these remnants of
the Last War appear in monstrous varieties, such as the
Forgeling titan (described on page 302).
Personality: The Forgeling were made to fight in
the Last War, and they continue to fulfill their purpose
with distinction. They fight fiercely and usually without
remorse, displaying adaptability impossible for mindless
constructs. Now that the war has ended, the Forgeling
seek to adapt to life in this era of relative peace. Some have
settled easily into new roles as artisans or laborers, while
others wander as adventurers or even continue fighting the
Last War despite the return of peace.
