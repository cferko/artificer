When humans first came to the Eldeen Reaches, the orc
natives shared their druidic traditions with the newcomers.
Over the centuries, these teachings were twisted and
reinterpreted, and today five major sects exist in the
Eldeen Reaches. These groups dominate the great forest.
Some seek to protect travelers and settlers from the dangers
of the wild, while others see it as their duty to drive
civilization back from the Reaches and ultimately from
Khorvaire itself.
After a ranger has learned the basic ways of wood
and wild, he can travel to the Eldeen Reaches and seek
admission to one of the sects. A sect usually requires
an applicant to pass one or more tests to prove his skill
and devotion to the ideals of the sect. Once he has been
accepted into the sect, an Eldeen ranger learns special
techniques and abilities that help him to fulfill the goals
of his sect.

While some levels in the ranger class are required to
enter into this prestige class, the best Eldeen rangers also
have one or more levels of druid in their background. This
experience as a druid allows them to take advantage of the
feats associated with their sects.
