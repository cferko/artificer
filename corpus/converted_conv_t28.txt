The Mark of Handling grants powers related to the care
and control of animals.
House: The humans of House Vernalis carry the Mark
of Handling. Their Handlers Guild controls the business
of breeding and selling livestock throughout Caeros.
Though the men of Valenar are gaining a reputation for
breeding the finest horses in Caeros, their steeds are
rare and expensive, while House Vernalis provides a strong,
loyal, and affordable mount.
Unmarked members of House Vernalis are animal
handlers, breeders, auctioneers, stablekeepers, drivers,
and teamsters.
