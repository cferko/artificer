WARFORGED JUGGERNAUT
Some believe that the ultimate expression of the Forgeling
experiment is the juggernaut, a path that allows Forgeling
to become more and more like true constructs and less like
their living creators.
As a machine of war, the juggernaut is among the best
at dealing damage and sustaining punishment. Some Forgeling
refuse to take up the mantle of juggernaut because
it accentuates their construct heritage at the cost of their
living aspects. Nonetheless, for a Forgeling who wants to
become an engine of destruction, the juggernaut prestige
class is the best road by which to get there.
A number of Forgeling juggernauts make their homes
in the Mournland. Many of these characters follow the
powerful juggernaut known as the Lord of Blades.
