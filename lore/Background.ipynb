This is modeled after the Great War in Eberron, but will introduce the presence of fantasy-based programming/AI in the game world. The forgespawn are sentient creates that fought in the war and then became free afterwards. Their overriding purpose fulfilled, the forespawn experienced a period of great turmoil as a people, when they struggled to find their place in the world. During this tumult, the knowledge of how to create intelligent forgespawn was destroyed in a series of attacks on House Cannith, although non-sentient constructs are still routinely produced."
